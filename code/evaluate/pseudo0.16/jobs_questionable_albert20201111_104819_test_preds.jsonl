the major constituent of senile plaques in alzheimer's disease is a 42-aa peptide, referred to as beta-amyloid (abeta). abeta is generated from a family of differentially spliced, type-1 transmembrane domain (tm)-containing proteins, called app, by endoproteolytic processing. the major, relatively ubiquitous pathway of app metabolism in cell culture involves cleavage by alpha-secretase, which cleaves within the abeta sequence, thus precluding abeta formation and deposition. an alternate secretory pathway, enriched in neurons and brain, leads to cleavage of app at the n terminus of the abeta peptide by beta-secretase, thus generating a cell-associated beta-c-terminal fragment (beta-ctf). a pathogenic mutation at codons 670/671 in app (app \"swedish\") leads to enhanced cleavage at the beta-secretase scissile bond and increased abeta formation. an inhibitor of vacuolar atpases, bafilomycin, selectively inhibits the action of beta-secretase in cell culture, suggesting a requirement for an acidic intracellular compartment for effective beta-secretase cleavage of app. beta-ctf is cleaved in the tm domain by gamma-secretase(s), generating both abeta 1-40 (90%) and abeta 1-42 (10%). pathogenic mutations in app at codon 717 (app \"london\") lead to an increased proportion of abeta 1-42 being produced and secreted. missense mutations in ps-1, localized to chromosome 14, are pathogenic in the majority of familial alzheimer's", "e37eef543acc42c0902146dfb8efe1c7": "which metabolite activates atxa?
